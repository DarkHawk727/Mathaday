# Mathaday

An Flutter app that lets you practise questions from various math contests. You get 3 new questions each day, and you can track your progress using statistics like streaks, percentage tried, best / weakest topics and most popular contests.

# Rationale
I wanted to try to build an app using flutter after seeing my friend, Connor, do it. I thought theming one around math contests would help keep my motivated , as it is something that I enjoy, and be somewhat beneficial.

# What I learned
* Flutter
  * Layout
  * Stateful and Stateless widgets
  * Databases
