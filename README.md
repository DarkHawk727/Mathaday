# Mathaday

An Flutter app that lets you practise questions from various math contests. You get 3 new questions each day, and you can track your progress using statistics like streaks, percentage tried, best / weakest topics and most popular contests.

# Rationale
I just really wanted to see how building an app was like. I thought theming one around math contests would help keep my motivated and be somewhat beneficial.

# What I learned
* Flutter
  * Layout
  * Stateful and Stateless widgets
  * Databases
* Various Flutter packages
  * fl_chart
  * firestore

# To-do

* Animations
* Login Screen
* Add notifications (like duolingo lmao)
